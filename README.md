# Advanced_Robotic_Arm

The arm control by robotics is very popular in the world of robotics. The essential part of the robotic arm is a programmable micro controller, capable of driving servos to form an anthropomorphic structure. 
The primary objective is to make a Robotic arm having servo motors, which can act as an interface with the In-Development of a Microcontroller Based Robotic Arm. It provides more interfaces to the outside world and has larger memory to store many programs.
The objectives for this project is to build and test a multi-discipline pick and place type robotic arm controller for use in a Manufacturing facility which could be setup in a relatively short period of time and configured to the most popular software type applications available. The aim of the controller is to reduce the high expenditure and setup time associated with it. This would ultimately increase sustainability in contrast to the alternative. To demonstrate the robotic arm controller for this project, a 6 axis servo controlled robotic arm titled is used. Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller is used for programming the Robotic arm.
